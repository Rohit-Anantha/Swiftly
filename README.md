#  Contributions

Guillermo Garcia Perez:

    1. I coded the storyboards and viewcontrollers for a lesson, it's questions, it's checkpoints, it's lectures and it's results with the exception of the Fill in The Blank type of questions. Drag and Drop was done with SwiftUI because it seemed simpler than with a storyboard.
    
    2. I also coded the classes that contain the information for each lesson element (question, checkpoint, lecture or results)

    1. I created the storyboard for the basic version of the login, create account, and forgot password pages.
    2. I coded the ability for colors to be selected for multiple choice, single choice, and
        true false.
    3. I wrote questions for different lessons and created lectures as well.
    4. Added the automatic login feature
    5. Added the colors for the circles based on whether the lesson is completed or not
