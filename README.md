#  Contributions

Guillermo Garcia Perez:

    1. I coded the storyboards and viewcontrollers for a lesson, it's questions, it's checkpoints, it's lectures and it's results with the exception of the Fill in The Blank type of questions. Drag and Drop was done with SwiftUI because it seemed simpler than with a storyboard.
    
    2. I also coded the classes that contain the information for each lesson element (question, checkpoint, lecture or results)
    
    
Rohit Anantha:

    1. I created the storyboard for the basic version of the login, create account, and forgot password pages.
    2. I coded the ability for colors to be selected for multiple choice, single choice, and
        true false.
    3. I wrote questions for different lessons and created lectures as well.
    4. I was out of country for spring break and wasn't able to contribute as much to the coding this release. I'll make it up during the next release
