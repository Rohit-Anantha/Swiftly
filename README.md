#  Contributions

Guillermo Garcia Perez:

    1. I coded the storyboards and viewcontrollers for a lesson, it's questions, it's checkpoints, it's lectures and it's results with the exception of the Fill in The Blank type of questions. Drag and Drop was done with SwiftUI because it seemed simpler than with a storyboard.
    
    2. I also coded the classes that contain the information for each lesson element (question, checkpoint, lecture or results)


# Deviations

Guillermo Garcia Perez:

    1. Added checkpoints and lectures to the lessons. Timers haven't been implemented yet.
