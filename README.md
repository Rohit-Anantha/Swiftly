#  Contributions

Guillermo Garcia Perez: (Release: 15%, Overall: 25%)

    1. I coded the storyboards and viewcontrollers for a lesson, it's questions, it's checkpoints, it's lectures and it's results with the exception of the Fill in The Blank type of questions. Drag and Drop was done with SwiftUI because it seemed simpler than with a storyboard.
    
    2. I also coded the classes that contain the information for each lesson element (question, checkpoint, lecture or results)
    Beta
    3. I implemented the timers on test question types and drag and drop questions types.

    4. I worked on computing the user’s score depending on the questions the user got correct and the time remaining for each timed question section. I also worked on storing the results on Firestore.

# Deviations
The original plan for this release was to focus on UI, but we decided to pull forward some features from the final release to get a headstart on them, such as the Firebase / Firestore aspects of it
